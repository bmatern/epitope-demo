Sample files and instructions for a live PIRCHE and HLA-EMMA demo



# How to register for PIRCHE

1) Go to research.pirche.com
2) First you have to make an account. It looks as if you need to pay for it, but there is a one-month free trial (indicated with a red band --1 month Free--) , choose for it. That is: first choose for "non-sponsored" and then "On-demand". *Do we need screen shots here? Non-sponsored button is not always available.* 
3) The account page should be familiar to you: you need to fill in your name, address and choose a password. 
4) After submission, you can directly login and start your first analysis. You will get an email with a contract, please ignore that. *Is this correct?*

2) Download the input file (in CSV format, stands dor "comma separated values") we provided for you: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmatern/epitope-demo/main/CaseStudies/SolidOrgan_1/PIRCHE_Input.csv. Open this file in a new tab in your browser. *The example we give does not work, we need 4 digit values and no missing values, can we get better examples from Eric?* 
4) In Pirche home page choose for "Single Patient" and copy and paste the patient and donor values (from PIRCHE_Input.csv file in step 3). You can copy full lines and paste them in the Input Wizard: <img width="1271" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18530731/159691608-0046f9d6-4e14-43bc-9499-753007b5750c.png">
