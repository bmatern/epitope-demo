# Contents

* "Slides" contains power point presentation, with an introduction to the epitope concepts.
* "CaseStudies" contains the input and output files for PIRCHE and HLA-EMMA analysis
 * You may still interpret the output files if the software is not avaialable at this moment.

# Case-study
(provided by Kirsten Geneugelijk) 

Patient_O., blood group B, is a 34 year old male who is on kidney dialysis for almost 4 years. He is registered on the active waiting list since September 2016. He has the following HLA typing:

`
Patient_O,A*02:01,A*01:01,B*07:02,B*08:01,C*07:01,C*07:02,DRB1*15:01,DRB1*03:01,DQB1*06:02,DQB1*02:01
`

The patient is not immunized, which means that he doesnâ€™t have detectable levels of preformed HLA antibodies. The father of patient O. (Donor O) is willing to donate her kidney to his son, but donor O has blood group A. The HLA typing of donor O. is the following:

`
Father,A*02:01,A*02:01,B*08:01,B*07:02,C*06:02,C*07:01,DRB1*03:01,DRB1*13:01,DQB1*06:02,DQB1*02:02
`

In the meantime the patient O. is still registered on the active kidney transplantation waiting list. At a certain time the patient get two deceased donor kidney offers.

Deceased donor 1 (blood group B) has the following HLA typing:

`
Deceased_1,A*02:01,A*01:01,B*44:03,B*08:01,C*01:02,C*07:02,DRB1*15:01,DRB1*03:01,DQB*06:02,DQB1*02:01
`

Deceased donor 2 (blood group B) has the following HLA typing:

`
Deceased_2,A*02:01,A*01:01,B*07:02,B*08:01,C*07:01,C*01:02,DRB1*15:01,DRB1*03:01,DQB1*06:02,DQB1*02:01
`

Which donor would you prefer to use for this kidney transplantation: a living donor or a deceased donor? Calculate PIRCHE and EMMA scores for each donor to help you make a decision. 

# How to register for PIRCHE

We have created temporary accounts to use PIRCHE during EFI 2022, you should have received an email inviting you to join Ben Matern's Laboratory in PIRCHE.com.

Please change your password. 

If there are troubles creating the account
* We can try to resolve it
* If it is a larger issue, the PIRCHE analysis output files are also provided in this repository [TODO: Add a Link]

# Analysis in PIRCHE 

1) Login at the [PIRCHE Website](http://www.pirche.com)

2) In the home page, choose SOT (solid organ transplantation) option (top right screen):<img width="1279" alt="HomePage" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18530731/159687485-8b1dc763-2744-4ce9-b76b-4abd29715d12.png">

3) Select "Single Patient". Copy-paste the patient and donor HLA strings from the Case Study above, into the "Input Wizard": <img width="1271" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18530731/159691608-0046f9d6-4e14-43bc-9499-753007b5750c.png">
 
4) Analyze your results....
