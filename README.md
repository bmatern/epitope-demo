# How to register for PIRCHE

1) Go to research.pirche.com
2) First you have to make an account. It looks as if you need to pay for it, but there is a one-month free trial (indicated with a red band --1 month Free--) , choose for it. That is: first choose for "non-sponsored" and then "On-demand". *Do we need screen shots here? Non-sponsored button is not always available.* 
3) The account page should be familiar to you: you need to fill in your name, address and choose a password. 
4) After submission, you can directly login and start your first analysis. You will get an email with a contract, please ignore that. *Is this correct?*
